# ETVAK - Malaria Detection App

## Project Overview

ETVAK is an innovative application designed to detect malaria using advanced deep learning techniques. The app leverages the power of neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to provide accurate and reliable disease identification. This project aims to facilitate early detection and timely treatment of malaria, potentially saving countless lives. The deep learning models were developed from scratch using TensorFlow, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/)
- TensorFlow: [Install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Malaria-Vision.git
    
    ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Machine Learning Model**:
    - Follow the instructions in the `model/` directory to set up and train the model.
    - Ensure you have the trained model file in the appropriate directory.

5. **Run the Application**:
    - Instructions for running the app should be added based on the specific framework or interface used.

## Usage

1. Open the app interface.
2. Use the interface to upload an image of a blood smear sample.
3. The app will analyze the image and provide a diagnosis, indicating whether malaria is detected.

## Model Training

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Ensure you have a dataset of blood smear images, labeled for malaria presence.
    - Preprocess the images as needed (e.g., resizing, normalization).

2. **Training the Model**:
    - Navigate to the `model/` directory.
    
    - This script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to train a CNN for malaria detection.
    - Use TensorBoard to visualize the training process and monitor performance.

3. **Achieving High Accuracy**:
    - The model was developed from scratch and fine-tuned to achieve 95% accuracy.

4. **Saving the Model**:
    - After training, the model will be saved as a checkpoint.
    - Ensure the checkpoint file is stored in the appropriate directory for later use.
